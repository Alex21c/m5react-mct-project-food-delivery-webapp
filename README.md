## Important 
You need to create an `.env` file in the root containing Firebase API Key and API ID.
Yours .env file should look like this
```
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY= Yours firebase api key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_ID= Yours firebase api ID
```
### How to get yours API Key & API ID
Now to get that API Key, you need to signup to [Google Firebase](console.firebase.google.com) and create new project and then crate new app,
while deploying yours app to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) you need to specify these Enviornmnet variables inside settings.
